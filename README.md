Financial Planning and Monte Carlo Simulations

This repository has a jupyter notebook file of my work on a fictional scenario, in which monte carlo simulations were run
for different lengths of time on a similar portfolio. The file, MCForecastTools, was imported into the notebook, such that
the user does not have to write the monte carlo code, functions can be called instead.

There is a 5, 10, and 30 year monte carlo sim run for the same portfolio. The 30 year may take a minute or two, and progress can
be seen as a print() function will print out the progress, usually every 10 scenarios, which can be adjusted in the MCForecastTool
file, if wanted.
